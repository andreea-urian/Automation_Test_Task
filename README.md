Please create a tiny C# utility to monitor Windows processes and kill the processes
that work longer than the threshold specified:
This command line utility expects three arguments: a process name, its
maximum lifetime (in minutes) and a monitoring frequency (in minutes, as
well). When you run the program, it starts monitoring processes with the
frequency specified. If a process of interest lives longer than the allowed
duration, the utility kills the process and adds the corresponding record to the
log. When no process exists at any given moment, the utility continues
monitoring (new processes might appear later). The utility stops when a
special keyboard button is pressed (say, q).
Here is the example: monitor.exe notepad 5 1 â€“ every other minute, the
program verifies if a notepad process lives longer than 5 minutes, and if it
does, the program kills the process.
When the first part of the task is completed, please cover the code with NUnit
tests that you find necessary for this program.
